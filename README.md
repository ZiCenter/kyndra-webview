# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Kyndra SDK Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate the **Kyndra SDK** to track user workouts using Flutter. You'll learn how to:

* Set up the Kyndra SDK.
* Track reps and errors.
* Subscribe to lifecycle events.
* Enable persistent wake-lock for sessions.
* Integrate the Kyndra AI-powered workout session view.

---

## üì¶ 1. Install Dependencies

In your `pubspec.yaml`, add:

```yaml
dependencies:
    kyndra:
        git:
            url: https://github.com/ZiCenter/kyndra-flutter.git
            ref: main
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## üß† 2. Core Concepts

### `WorkflowController`

This manages the workout session lifecycle and streams rep counts, errors, and lifecycle events.

### `WorkflowWidget`

Embeds the workout experience (typically rendered in a `WebView`). Supports **2-way communication** for controlling
workout sessions remotely.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. Integration Steps

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Initialize SDK

Inside your widget‚Äôs `initState`, subscribe to reps, errors, and lifecycle streams from the `WorkflowController`.

```dart
final WorkflowController controller = WorkflowController();

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();

  controller.reps.listen(handleRep);
  controller.errors.listen(handleError);
  controller.lifecycle.listen(handleLifecycleEvent);
}
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Embed Workout UI

Use the `WorkflowWidget` to display the workout session, typically embedded inside a `Stack` for flexibility.

```dart
WorkflowWidget(
  workflow: _workflowController,
  url: "https://kyndra-web.vercel.app/session/<session_id>", // Replace with your session URL
)
```

---

## üì¥ 3. Clean Up

Unsubscribe streams in `dispose()` and dispose controller:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  controller.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

---

## üì± 5. Recommended UX Enhancements

* **Keep screen awake**: Use `wakelock_plus` to prevent screen from sleeping during workouts.

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  WakelockPlus.enable();
}

@override
void dispose() {
  WakelockPlus.disable();
  super.dispose();
}
```

* **Orientation lock**: Force portrait mode for consistent tracking (optional).
* **Error UI**: Display friendly messages if errors occur in the workflow.

# üåê WebView Inbound Commands

The Kyndra WebView now supports **inbound commands** that can be sent from Flutter to control workout sessions remotely.

## üì§ Available Inbound Commands

| **Command**        | **Description**                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `command-pause`    | Pause the current exercise workflow             |
| `command-resume`   | Resume the paused exercise workflow             |
| `command-next`     | Skip to the next exercise in the session        |
| `command-previous` | Go back to the previous exercise in the session |

## üîß Sending Commands from Flutter

Use the `WorkflowController.sendCommand()` method to send these commands to the WebView:

```dart
// Send inbound commands to control the WebView
controller.sendCommand('command-pause');
```

These commands will trigger the corresponding actions in the WebView and generate appropriate response events in the
lifecycle stream.
